                <h3>Introduction</h3>
                <h4>The Way She Perceives the World</h4>
                <p class="space">Influenced by her heritage and the school, 37 has been obsessed with mathematics since childhood. Because of her insight into the "abstract world," she is able to perceive the world in the form of numbers. Or rather, her perception of the world is only in the form of numbers.</p>
                <p class="space">In 37's world, integers are her friends, irrational numbers are free spirits, prime numbers are tricky, and composite numbers are amiable. 3 is a good number, 6 is a good number, 7 is a goodnumber and 1001 is also a good number.</p>
                <p>If you ask her about what happened in 1999, she will tell you, "How fun! 1999 is a lovely centeredtriangular number!"</p>
                <h4>A Passionate Scholar and Indifferent Genius</h4>
                <p>37 has a strong affection for the "abstract world" and loves to share her knowledge. She is a passionate scholar and a devout priestess, but also an indifferent daughter and friend. Well, she's not really indifferent—it's just that she has invested all her emotions in the "abstract world," leaving little for reality and those around her. Her emotions toward others are associated with abstractions rather than their interactions with her.</p>
                <h4>The World She Doesn't Care About</h4>
                <p class="space">37, a mathematical genius who is not so interested in the world of Matter. She would care if a plate is perfectly placed according to the golden ratio, but not what is actually on the plate. Of course, she also follows the rules of the school strictly.</p>
                <p>"Abstain from beans; Do not pick up what has fallen; Touch not a white rooster ..." She adheres to the precepts as if they were the laws of the world. This is the only way she knows life. To her everything is trivial compared to the "abstract world."</p>

                            <p>A pure white shawl with a mystical aura, intricately woven with openwork geometric patterns, serving as a doorway to ancient wisdom. "Wearing geometry doesn't do much to inspire creativity," the interviewee calmly declares.</p>

                            <p>A pair of tropical cave-dwelling bird companions, primitive, mysterious, and enigmatic. According to the interviewee, they sometimes part but never for long, they remain exactly as they were the day she arrived. Perhaps somethings never change- at least she firmly believes so.</p>

                <h3>Story</h3>
                <h4>Kingdom of Math</h4>
                <p class="space">Statistics, physics, astronomy, engineering... Mathematics finds applications in various scientific fields. Humans naturally believe themselves to be the sole darlings of these concise and lucid numbers. They devote themselves to expelling the Arcanists that symbolize disorder and chaos in number theory, all to preserve the harmony and unity of mathematics.</p>
                <p class="space">However, this remains merely a wish.</p>
                <p class="space">The realm of pure reason has never truly existed; perpetually hanging above it is the cloud of Gnosis.</p>
                <p class="space">Arcanum and rational systems; religious beliefs and scientific proof; the notion that "all things have numbers" and mathematics. They are all like two sides of a ruler, measuring everything in the world. The followers of Pythagoreanism have made significant contributions throughout history, and the theories of fundamental numbers have left an indelible mark on many.</p>
                <p>However, the "Storm" swept unrelentingly throughout the world. Mathematics lost its once solid ground, leaving nothing but debris. Then, a pair of tender hands picked it up.</p>

                <h4>An Unfinished Demonstration</h4>
                <p class="space"><b>On the Supplementary Calculations of Soul Number 37</b></p>
                <p class="space"><i>I hereby declare to approach this task with impartiality, to eliminate errors and omissions, and to treat each number with fairness, as I uphold the unique guidelines of a Corrector.</i></p>
                <p>1: The smallest irregular prime number</p>
                <p class="space"><i>Note: Based on the "Primitive Bernoulli Number" criterion, which is a rational number sequence closely related to number theory.</i></p>
                <p>2: Repeating unit 111 (three consecutive 1s, where 3 is a prime number), 111 = 3 x 37</p>
                <p class="space"><i>Note: She avoids the division between "finite" and "infinite."</i></p>
                <p>3: Any number can be expressed as the sum of at most 37 fifth powers of 5</p>
                <p class="space"><i>Note: She is special, possessing multiple possibilities.</i></p>
                <p>4: A regular hexagon</p>
                <p><i>Note: This corresponds to her influence and importance in the School of Apeiron.</i></p>
                <p>...</p>
                <p>37 is the third unique prime number in the decimal system and the third isolated prime number without a twin prime. It is the third Cuban prime, the fourth prime, the fifth lucky prime...</p>

                <h4>Geometric Problem</h4>
                <p><b class="she">37:</b> Oh! Another set of contradictions.</p>
                <p><b>Pandora Wilson:</b> Although I know very little about mathematics, I can sense the disappointment from your tone.</p>
                <p><b class="she">37:</b> Free, selfish, untraceable—traits of irrational numbers. Fortunately, it adheres to coherence and maintains clear boundary criteria...</p>
                <p><b>Pandora Wilson:</b> I hope this won't affect our conversation.</p>
                <p><b class="she">37:</b> Of course not, addressing various math puzzles is precisely my job; I excel at it.</p>
                <p><b class="she">37:</b> Now, please open up your quadratic surface.</p>
                <p><b>Pandora Wilson:</b> ...</p>
                <p><b>Pandora Wilson:</b> Ah—?</p>
                <p><b class="she">37:</b> Fantastic! In Apeiron, we often engage with spheres and regular polyhedra... Opportunities to study special surfaces are quite rare.</p>
                <p><b class="she">37:</b> Clearly, you don't belong to real quadratic surfaces, nor do you align with degenerate quadratic surfaces. But it's alright; I will find a place for you in the geometric classification of three-dimensional Euclidean space.</p>
                <p><b>Pandora Wilson:</b> ...Thank you.</p>
