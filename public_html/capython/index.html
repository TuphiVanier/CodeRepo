    <h3>Level 8</h3>
        <p>I almost always have all of my materials and work completed that I need for my studio and am ready to learn. I am mostly organized and and can keep my things in good condition. I take good care of things for which I am responsible. I have created an organizational system for my digital files and am working to consistently use it.</p>
